Library|Time to read (s)|Time to write (s)|Memory footprint of json value (MB)|Remarks
---|---|---|---|---
[jsoncons](https://github.com/danielaparker/jsoncons)|4.434|0.786|343|Uses sorted `std::vector` of key/value pairs for objects, expect smaller memory footprint.Uses slightly modified [grisu3_59_56 implementation by Florian Loitsch](https://florian.loitsch.com/publications) plus fallback for printing doubles, expect faster serializing.
[nlohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)|7.044|2.707|410|Uses `std::map` for objects. Uses slightly modified [Grisu2 implementation by Florian Loitsch](https://florian.loitsch.com/publications) for printing doubles, expect faster serializing.
[rapidjson](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson)|2.128|0.637|332|Uses custom floating point parsing, expect faster parsing. Uses girsu3 for printing doubles, expect faster serializing. Uses custom allocation and flat map for objects, expect smaller memory footprint.
[jsoncpp](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp)|14.848|6.632|1985|Uses std::map for both arrays and objects, expect larger memory footprint.
[taojson](https://github.com/taocpp/json)|14.006|2.762|1038|Uses modified [google/double conversion](https://github.com/google/double-conversion) routines for parsing doubles. Uses modified [jeaiii/itoa](https://github.com/jeaiii/itoa) routines for outputting integers. Uses slightly modified [Grisu2 implementation by Florian Loitsch](https://florian.loitsch.com/publications) for printing doubles, expect faster serializing.
